All code must be inside a class.
Before java variable can be used, they must be declared.
All variables and expressions have a static type. 
- Java variables must have a specific type.
- Java variables type can never be changed.
- Type are verified before the code runs.
- The compiler ensures that all types are compatible.
Functions
- Functions must be declared as a part of a class and are called as a method.
- Define a function as: public static.
- All parameters and the return value mush have a declared type.
- Functions in Java only return one value.
Array
- int[] numbers = new int [3];
- numbers[0] = 1;
- numbers[1] = 2;
- numbers[2] = 5;
For loop
for(initialization; termination; increment){
...
}
Enhanced For loop
String[] a = {'cat', 'dog', 'horse'};
for (String s : a){
...
}

git bash
- vi hello.java #edit hello.java, press 'I' to edit, press 'esc' to exit edit mode, enter ':wq' to go back to command line

git - github
- git clone https://github.com/lihanhu/cs61b #paste the repo to the current path
- git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton-sp19.git
- git pull skeleton master or git pull --rebase --allow-unrelated-histories skeleton master #Get the most recent copy of the files as seen in remote-repo-name
#The repo in Berkeley has been copied.
- mv D:/hello.txt hello.txt #move file from another path to current location, '/' instead of '\'
- git add hello.txt
- git commit -m 'complete part1'
- git push -u orgin master -f #Pushes the most recent copy of your files to the remote-repo-name
#push the new file into github

Part 2: Objects
Not all class has main.
Create an array of objects:
- Use the new keyword to create the array
- Use new again for each object that you want to put into the array
Dog[] dogs = new Dog[2];
Dog[0] = new Dog(8);
Dog[1] = new Dog(20);
Dog[0].makeNoise();

Static vs Non-Static(instance) method
- Static methods are invoked by Class name #Dog.makenoise()
- Static methods cannot use 'my' instance variables
- Instance methods are invoked by an instance name #mayadog.makenoise()
