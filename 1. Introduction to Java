- Define a function as: public static.
- All parameters and the return value mush have a declared type.
- Functions in Java only return one value.
Array
- int[] numbers = new int [3];
- numbers[0] = 1;
- numbers[1] = 2;
- numbers[2] = 5;
For loop
for(initialization; termination; increment){
...
}
Enhanced For loop
String[] a = {'cat', 'dog', 'horse'};
for (String s : a){
